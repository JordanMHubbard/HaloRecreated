# Halo Recreated

This project is my attempt at recreating the mechanics and game feel of Halo 3 while also adding my own unique design. It features classic Halo combat alongside a new enemy type and map. 

### Features

- Recreated Halo-style shooting, aiming, and movement
- Custom enemy AI inspired by Covenant aliens
- Custom-designed map that blends Halo-inspired flow with my own level design
- Built in Unreal Engine 5.4

### Goals

This project was created to:
- Deepen my understanding of FPS mechanics and feel
- Experiment with AI design and level flow
- Explore what makes Halo's combat and level design special and add my own twist
